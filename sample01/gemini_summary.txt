Using the following transcript from the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv49RRuAI7w: 'what is the ideal meeting structure that provides the right amount of communication without overburdening us real quick I want to mention that Patrick lynchione the author of five dysfunctions of a team also wrote a book called Death by meeting and so there's for me that's very literal like like I was mentioning I've had two heart problems in my professional career where I was getting palpitations and electrical issues that they thought at one point I needed a pacemaker both of those were when I was investing too much of my personal time and energy to help things go right and it worked beautifully by the way because there's nothing more powerful than the leader being their present with each of the team members holding them accountable but as Patrick lincione says in five dysfunctions of a team probably the best accountability there is is group accountability so our job as as business owners and CEOs isn't isn't to facilitate it's to have it's to inspire them to hold themselves accountable so how do we do that well the meeting structure is to be efficient and so on there's a couple of different things that I recommend the first is the weekly team meeting so when we talk about team meetings we're looking at two types of Team meetings we're looking at executive teams and we're looking at clinical teams so this might be one in the same depending on your size of company when we had five locations at one point I would meet with my executive team that was my me my head of marketing my head of operations and her right hand and our head of billing we would meet for an hour and then right when they would leave all of the clinical directors would come in and sit down and with the the head of operations in her right hand and me we would go through the same exact agenda but with our directors and then once a week those directors were having a weekly team meeting with their Clinic so it's the same agenda across the board of of what we cover in all three and it drives a couple of things so the very first thing we do is a warm-up that's where in our case we would do something called a one word open it takes less than a minute all right guys how you feeling today happy concerned worried all these things we've reviewed the meeting rules by the way I have all these agendas if you want them let me know I will you can white label them meeting rules and by the way I do this now with all my current companies with my billing company with my multiple exit company any company that I have partners and team and employees we have almost 40 employees now in the black like I run the same structure because it works so well once we get into meeting rules then we go over purpose and values we have somebody from the team including me at times share a thought about the company purpose and the company values this first thing takes 15 minutes so the total meaning agenda time for these meetings is no more than 60 minutes now these are team meetings these aren't one-on-ones and so for clinical meetings we'd have them block time that would overlap with their lunch but would also cut into treatment time because we wanted them to have some degree of like you're being paid to be here kind of thing but we also knew it was part of their investment in being a part of the team so they'd bring their lunches and they'd go through this agenda someone would share a purpose Vision Values piece then from there we go into stats and graphs and the way that I recommend doing this is what Robert was mentioning regarding the red yellow green approach this is probably its own module of training so I can't get too far into it but let me paint to you what the vision looks like for those of you who have who are doing none of this it's going to seem incredibly overwhelming just be patient it's really good that you're seeing the end in mind now this is honestly better so when you're looking so after everyone's feeling connected and they remember why they love the company and they're feeling like a team then we go great how did we do one two three and then everyone would hold up their graph that they already had and what we did is we looked at a six-week trend of their key statistic that they were that they owned and it showed the graph of the line so like this was obviously growing this was flat this was not doing well and so everyone would go around and look at each other's graphs and report on their statistic by mentioning the main reason one or two reasons that people love to like politic and just explain themselves away like we make it really narrow give us one or two reasons as to why that statistic is in that state why is it doing well why is it suffering and then what's the one thing if you read the book The One Thing that book base let me summarize the whole book in one sentence when we know the one thing by so doing will eliminate or make unnecessary everything else we have them share their one thing they're going to do that week for that statistic to help it go right some people week after week earn a downward trend if that's the case we put them in the last part of the meeting which is the last half hour which is the parking lot parking lot is where we put items for discussion that require group effort and it can be anything it can be training it can be clinical training it can be stat support so that John the physical therapist who's been below his minimum standard for two weeks in a row isn't having to just talk to the owner he's talking to his team and they're going hey John how can we help you get your stat up it creates this culture of like crap I have to hold my stat up to my team it no longer becomes about you which is what it usually is when we're holding those discussions if I can keep my owner happy I'm fine that's not what we want them thinking we want them thinking if I can keep my team happy I'm fine right and that's when the pressure comes off of us it's hard to even describe the freedom of what that feels like but when you get to that point where you have a director who's tied in financially and they're managing their team they're leading their team through these statistics in these parking lot items that's when it really grows and so this is the weekly agenda and we do the same thing on the exec level we do the same thing so the the graphs at the exact level when I had five locations was more than just people holding their stat it was me pulling up a spreadsheet that I created and I'm happy to share that shows the key statistics for each clinic by individual and it automatically was formatted to go red yellow green summarize the clinic the individual's efforts so it was a little bit more more in depth and we would pull out the key issues that way and solve problems that way but at a one location company this was enough just to have that but it's really important that if you are the person running that meeting that we work immediately at getting a right hand a future Clinical Director if you will who's going to run that meeting for us that is a vital step to get somebody else running that team meeting then what we would do is we would do personal check-ins and these I never allotted a specific amount of time for it and schedule them other than to say um like with with my key people so I would only meet when I was CEO of that company with those four people my head of marketing my head of operations her her right hand because she was kind of like in between and then her biller so I meet with them every week with my biller that was a scheduled meeting but it was 15 minutes and it was more than what are you working on and how can I help you she would go into some billing depth and that's what we do for our clients in the black is we create that level of clarity that fast but when it comes to the other people it was just what are you working on and how can I help you and it was a standing time frame where it wasn't officially scheduled but they knew I'd be checking in with them and sometimes it was just a phone call because we were you know in very different Geographic areas at one point you had to drive three hours from one part of my company to the other so we weren't always physically together but I just pick up the phone hey I was just thinking about you what are you working on how can I help you and she knew what I was doing they were all females so they knew what he was doing she knew what I was doing when I called but then the owner the directors would do the same thing it wasn't scheduled it was just like on the fly so directors would typically use their admin time to do it', provide a concise and factual summary (100-150
